# Travrlopia-take-home-task
I've done the implementation of this take home task fro the java ful stack developer role using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend and Node.js with Express and MongoDB on the backend.
Front End - Download the file travelopia.html and add the following code to the Visual Studio code or any editor of your choice, repeat the same for css.
This code sets up the HTML structure for a background slideshow so paste the images attached here to the right destination for the smooth functioning of the code.
Back End - Install necessary dependencies: npm install express body-parser cors mongoose, download the file travelopia.js, 
This code sets up an Express server, connects to a local MongoDB database, defines a schema and model for the form data, and defines two API endpoints for receiving and retrieving form submissions.
The /form POST endpoint saves a new form submission to the database, and the /form GET endpoint retrieves all existing form submissions.
Note that this code assumes you have MongoDB installed and running locally on your machine.
Now that we have the backend is set up, the code must run fine.
hope you like my work.
